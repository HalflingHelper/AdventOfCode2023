# Advent Of Code 2023
My second advent of code! Wherein I hope to actually finish every challenge.

My goal is to use this year as an opportunity to become more familiar with parts of lua that I have formerly neglected, including file i/o and the string library. Another fun part of this year is getting the chance to implement various data structures in Lua for the first time.

## My favorite problems

5\. [If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5) - I got to write a fun recursive solution \
6. [Wait For It](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6) - Getting to find a clean mathematical calculation was a fun addition to just parsing and counting data. \
7. [Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7) - Lots of fun logic. \
9. [Mirage Maintenance](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9) - Cool concept with a fun recursive solution.\
17. [Clumsy Crucible](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17) - Honestly quite painful, but finding and optimizing a solution felt really good. Implementing a heap was fun too. \
19. [Aplenty](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/19) - Parts one and two were both fun in different ways. Utilizing pattern matching to parse expressions, using anonymous functions, and getting to write recursive code. \
22. [Sand Slabs](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/22) - I was initially quite intimidated by this one but it ended up being a really fun problem and a nice breather from the pain of the past two days. \
24. [Never Tell Me The Odds](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/24) - A fun linear algebra problem for part 1, and I felt that part two had a really creative way to simplify search space and find a solution. Also a case of using what you know about input to make time-saving assumptions. \
25. [Snowverload](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/25) - This problem became surprisingly fun, and I enjoyed learning about Kargel's algorithm a lot, as I had no prior knowledge of random algorithms (other than Bogosort).
