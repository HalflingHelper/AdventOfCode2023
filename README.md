# Advent Of Code 2023
My second advent of code! Wherein I hope to actually finish every challenge.

My goal is to use this year as an opportunity to become more familiar with parts of lua that I have formerly neglected, including file i/o and the string library. Another fun part of this year is getting the chance to implement various data structures in Lua for the first time.

My favorite problems this year: \
    5\. [If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5) \
    6. [Wait For It](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6) \
    8. [Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8) \
    9. [Mirage Maintenance](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)
