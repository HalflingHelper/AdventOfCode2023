# Advent Of Code 2023
My second advent of code! Wherein I hope to actually finish every challenge.

My goal is to use this year as an opportunity to become more familiar with parts of lua that I have formerly neglected, including file i/o and the string library. Another fun part of this year is getting the chance to implement various data structures in Lua for the first time.

My favorite problems this year: \
    5\. [If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5) - I got to write a fun recursive solution \
    6. [Wait For It](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6) - Getting to find a clean mathematical calculation was a fun addition to just parsing and counting data. \
    7. [Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7) - Lots of fun logic. \
    9. [Mirage Maintenance](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9) - Cool concept with a fun recursive solution.\
    17. [Clumsy Crucible](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17) - Honestly quite painful, but finding and optimizing a solution felt really good. Implementing a heap was fun too.
